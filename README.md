# TheraView
TheraView is a portable two angle capture system for physical therapy and occupational therapy. The goal is to build a simple and affordable kit that records sessions at high quality, offers a live preview, supports synchronized dual camera use, and later adds pose analysis and activity tools. TheraView is part of the RITA Project.
