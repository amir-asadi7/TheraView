# TheraView
TheraView is a portable two angle capture system for physical therapy and occupational therapy. The goal is to build a simple and affordable kit that records sessions at high quality, offers a live preview, supports synchronized dual camera use, and later adds pose analysis and activity tools. TheraView is part of the RITA Project.

## Roadmap

### Stage 1: Single Camera Unit *(Current Stage)*
- Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite ✅
- Verify 1080p at 30 FPS capture with MJPG ✅
- Add GStreamer preview output to an HTML page ✅
- Confirm recording stability 
- Test power bank duration 
- Add the first enclosure design
- Use the Bluetooth button on the tripod mount to trigger camera recording
- Add an RTC module for reliable time tracking

### Stage 2: Dual Camera System
- Add a second camera setup
- Add synchronized start across both units
- Build a page that displays the two live previews
- Improve local network coordination
- Add a auto file transfer system when connected to an external HDD

### Stage 3: Synchronized Recording and Playback
- Align timelines between both units
- Create a playback layout with two camera angles
- Add session metadata
- Improve storage flow and file handling

### Stage 4: Pose Detection
- Apply pose models to recorded sessions
- Produce structured data for therapist review
- Add export and visualization tools
- Add a privacy layer that captures only pose and activity data instead of raw video when desired

### Stage 5: Activity and Game Layer
- Train models for specific therapy tasks
- Add workflow logic for guided activities
- Add simple games that respond to pose output

### Stage 6: External Processing Unit
- Add an external processor for real time analysis
- Offload compute tasks from Raspberry Pi units
- Improve overall performance of the streaming and analysis pipeline

## Hardware

- **Raspberry Pi 4B**
- **Microsoft LifeCam Studio**  
  Any USB webcam that supports 1080p MJPG at 30 FPS can be used.
- **Power bank** 10,000 mAh, 22.5 W output (Anker)  
  *Operation duration: [to be tested]*
- **MicroSD card** 64 GB , class TBD
- **Cooling fan for Raspberry Pi**
- **3D printed enclosure:** [to be added]
- **Tripod mount**  
  This model (link TBA ) was used and the enclosure design follows this choice.
  It also includes a Bluetooth button used to trigger camera control.
- **Optional future processing unit**
- **SD card reader

## Setup Guide


Use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) with advanced settings before writing the SD cards.

Use the Raspberry Pi Imager with advanced settings before you write the SD cards.

### Hostnames
- **TVA** for unit one  
- **TVB** for unit two  

Set these exactly as shown because the setup process relies on them.

### Username
- **pi**

### Password
- Choose your own secure password.

### Wireless LAN
The device needs internet access during setup and the first test run, so configure WiFi here. A mobile hotspot works.  
If you use an iPhone hotspot, rename the phone. Default names such as `John's iPhone` include an apostrophe, which the Raspberry Pi rejects. Use a simple name such as `John iPhone`.

Select the wireless LAN country that matches your location.

### Locale
Choose your timezone and keyboard layout.

### Services
- Enable **SSH**  
- Use **password authentication**

### First Boot
After the SD card is ready, place it in the Raspberry Pi and power it on.

Allow a few minutes for the first boot, then connect from a computer on the same network:

```bash
ssh pi@TVA.local
# or
ssh pi@TVB.local
```
If hostname lookup does not work, find the device IP with a network scanner and connect to that address instead.



After you connect to the RPi

```
sudo apt install git
git clone [https://github.com/NeuroRehack/TheraView](https://github.com/NeuroRehack/TheraView)
cd TheraView
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/setup.sh
```

Note: If you do not want the system to auto start on systemd or set up the hotspot, edit the config file at config/theraview.config and change these flags: ENABLE_SYSTEMD and ENABLE_HOTSPOT
